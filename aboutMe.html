<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello thank you for coming to my page to learn about the things that I do and the things that I have gotten done. Right
now I would say that I am a beginner in coding compared to other people right now. I was raised in brooklyn and have two older siblings.
What got me in to coding was the movie Matrix and seeing so much Batman cartoons and movies and seeing him overcome obstacles by coding and other things.
I wanted to do the things they were doing so I decided to start coding by being in a coding class in my school and from there on I have been coding for a while now and getting better every
chance I get.</p>
